Introduction
This project demonstrates how to perform Question-Answering (QA) on custom data using Meta's LLaMA-2-7b-chat model, integrated with the LangChain framework and FAISS library. The model can be applied to various documents, and in this example, we use a web-based document.

Features
Large Language Model: Utilizes the LLaMA-2-7b-chat model, a powerful language model with advanced capabilities.
FAISS Integration: Efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
LangChain Integration: Framework for building applications with language models.
Web Document Loader: Loads and processes web-based documents for QA tasks.
Conversational Retrieval: Maintains chat history for contextual question answering.
Installation
To get started, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nlp-project.git
cd nlp-project
Create a Virtual Environment

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Dependencies

bash
Copy code
pip install accelerate==0.21.0 transformers==4.31.0 tokenizers==0.13.3
pip install bitsandbytes==0.40.0 einops==0.6.1 xformers==0.0.22.post7

Usage
Configure the Script

Ensure you have an access token from Hugging Face. Replace <your-access-token> in app.py with your actual token.
Run the Script

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Code Explanation
app.py
This script initializes and runs the QA model:

Imports and Configuration

Imports necessary libraries and configures the model and device.
Model Initialization

Loads the LLaMA-2-7b-chat model with quantization settings to optimize GPU usage.
Document Loading

Uses WebBaseLoader to load documents from a web link.
Text Splitting

Splits the loaded documents into manageable chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.
Embedding and Vector Store

Generates embeddings for the document chunks and stores them using FAISS.
Conversational Retrieval Chain

Sets up a retrieval chain to answer questions based on the loaded documents.
Example Queries

Demonstrates example queries and responses using the model.
